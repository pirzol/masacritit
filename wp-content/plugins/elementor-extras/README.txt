Elementor Extras is a premium Wordpress plugin for Elementor, extending its capability with seriously useful new widgets and extensions

== Description ==

Elementor Extras is a premium Wordpress plugin for Elementor. It extends its capability with a lot of new widgets and extensions that make Elementor even more powerful.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure Elementor is installed and active on your website
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Edit a page (or post) using Elementor
3. Find and use the new widgets and extensions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Elementor Extras work with any version of Elementor? =

* We usually check compatibility whenever a new Elementor or WordPress update is available. Like with any other products that depend on a particular plugin, we have no way of knowing what those updates are and how that impacts this product. We always encourage waiting a few days before updating plugin on a live environment.

= Can I use this plugin with the free version of Elementor? =

* Most of the widget work with the free version. Extensions such as Parallax for the Portfolio widget (which comes with the Pro version of Elementor) will only work with Elementor Pro. The Posts Extra widget required Elementor Pro installed and activated.

= On the Single Site license, can I activate the plugin on a development environment? =

* Yes. You can activate licenses on local environments without limit and they won't take from your allowed activations count.
